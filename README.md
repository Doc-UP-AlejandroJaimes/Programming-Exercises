# Programming Exercises

This repository contains a collection of programming exercises organized by difficulty level and programming language. It is designed to help students and developers improve their skills by solving practical problems.

## Repository Structure

The repository is divided into two difficulty levels:

- **Basic**
- **Intermediate**

Each level contains exercises in different programming languages:

- **Java**
- **Python**

### Python Exercises
The Python exercises are organized into numbered folders, each representing a specific problem. Inside each folder, you will find:

- A main file containing the exercise implementation.
- A test file to validate the solution.

Example Python structure:
```
Basic/
 ├── Python/
 │   ├── 1_find_uppercase/
 │   │   ├── uppercase_finder.py
 │   │   ├── test_uppercase_finder.py
 │   ├── 2_filter_planets/
 │   ├── 3_count_negatives/
 │   ├── 4_lucky_list/
```

### Java Exercises
Java exercises follow a similar structure, organized into folders based on difficulty level and problem name.

## Requirements
To run the exercises, you will need:

- **Python:** Version 3.8 or higher
- **Java:** JDK 11 or higher
